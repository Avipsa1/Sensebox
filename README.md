# OpenPICMap:Sensebox

An application that reads data from Arduino as input and provides a user-friendly
interface to visualise the sensor data using R - Shiny.

The data is read as a csv file from a central location into R. Further analysis is
done in `R` , a statistical tool ,based on concepts related to various scene selections and factors that contribute to clicking a perfect picture based on weather conditions detected by the `Sensebox`. 

1. Install `RStudio`.
2. Display results using `R shiny`.
3. Read data from sensebox through `Arduino`.
